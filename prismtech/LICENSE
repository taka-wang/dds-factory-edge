1. License Evaluation 
 
1.1  In consideration of the sum of $1 (receipt of which is hereby acknowledged) paid to the Licensor by the Licensee, the Licensor hereby grants to the Licensee the non-exclusive non-transferable right to use the Software upon the terms and conditions of this Agreement for a period of thirty (30) days from the date of downloading the Software (the “Evaluation Period”) for the purpose only of evaluating whether or not the Software meets the Licensee’s requirements. Unless otherwise agreed in writing by Licensor one specific named person only is permitted to use the Software for evaluation purposes and further downloads by Licensee after the expiry of the initial Evaluation Period are prohibited. The Software shall not under any circumstances be used for developing a new application or for deploying a particular application or program created with the Software. 
 
1.2  Licensee shall use the Software solely for its own evaluation purposes. Licensee shall not provide or otherwise make available the Software in whole or in part to any third party and Licensee shall not permit any third party to use the Software save for contractors of Licensee, under supervision of Licensee, at Licensee’s premises and provided that such contractors are bound by written agreement to compliance with the terms of this Agreement. Licensee shall ensure compliance by such third party contractors to such terms.

2.  Expiry of Evaluation Period
